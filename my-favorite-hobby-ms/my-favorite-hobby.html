<h2>Where it all began</h2>

<p>My love for working out and staying active started at a very young age. I was involved in many sports growing up and learning to play on a team with others was a great feeling. I love feeling that I am a part of something and that others count on me. At age 17, I made decision that would change my life forever.. I decided to join the <a href="https://www.marines.mil/" target="_blank"> United States Marine Corps!</a></p>

<p><a href="#MyWorkouts">Training</a> for the Marines and while in, required a lot of physical and mental strength. I was a female in the Armed Forces, therefore, I had to prove that I could do what any man standing next to me could. Working out became my hobby, it helped me to become stronger not just physically but mentally as well. It gave me courage, pushed me to my limits, and awarded me for my success. </p>

<h2>Greatest Accomplishment</h2>
<p>I worked very hard throughout my training learning the science behind muscles, cells, and our body. Five years passed and I landed back in the States after being stationed in Japan, Korea, Guam, and other countries. I continued working out  and many women would look up to me and ask for advice. My greatest accomplishment is that I was able to help other women understand the biology of their bodies and train them. I taught them that it is not all about how we look, but that we fall in love with ourselves, accept ourselves, and pass that message on to younger women growing up. </p>

<h2>Training Schedule</h2>
<p>Today, my training schedule is very different from when I was training full time in the Marines. I now have a four year old boy, a three year old German Shepard, I am a full time student, and I work full time. The good thing about having a hobby is that somehow and someway I will find a way to do it for my own mental health. The table below describes how I would schedule my week.</p>
